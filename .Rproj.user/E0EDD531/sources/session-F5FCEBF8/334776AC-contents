## Background to data analysis


Data analysis was done using R version 4.1.2 for Mac. There were 26 responses in total. The survey was closed prior to nutrition presentations delivered at the ICU on nutrition in critical care.

The following summary tables provide additional details. There were 24 out of 26 responses for the question, How many years have you been working in the ICU? Responses ranged from 2 days to 6 years. So, the responses were recoded to include responses less than 1 year and responses greater than 1 year which was used for the final analysis.  

The years of experience of the respondents in terms of their professional qualification was grouped into less than 3 years of working experience and greater or equal to 3 years of working experience based on the median years of experience. 

This current draft does not contain plots for the multiple responses as I am trying to code that as well. The plots should be done in the revised version of the analysis report. Additional plots in the draft report are visualizations of the information present in the tables.Final and more polished plots will be created after our review. 

The other source of nutrition information had 2 responses. One response indicated literature and the other indicated media as the other source of information. The literature response was added to the journal articles category and the other category name was changed to media as there was only 1 response of other source of nutrition information.

Doctor and pharmacist were collectively categorised as doctors and general and critical care nurses were categorised as nurses in the professional group used for the sub-group analysis.
